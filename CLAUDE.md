# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in **Revisely**. `README.md` covers setup, tests and the branch table; this
file is the release mechanics and the traps behind them.

## Branches and releases

- Work on `develop` (or a branch off it). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and PR.
- **A push to `main` is a release.** Merge `develop` into `main` through a PR, only once CI is green.
  `EAS Update` (`.github/workflows/update.yml`) then publishes the JS to the `production` channel, and
  starts a TestFlight build first if native code changed.
- Never run `eas update` or `eas build` from a laptop to ship. Everything on a phone should trace to a
  commit on `main`.
- Pushes that touch only docs, tests, `functions/`, Firestore rules or `.md` files do not release
  (`paths-ignore` in `update.yml`). Firebase rules and functions still deploy by hand
  (`firebase deploy`, see README).

## Runtime version is a fingerprint

`runtimeVersion: { policy: "fingerprint" }` in `app.config.js`: an update reaches only binaries built
from the same native code. The workflow computes the iOS fingerprint, looks for a production build
with it (`eas build:list --runtimeVersion`), builds and auto-submits if there is none, then publishes.

The hash must come out identical on a laptop, the GitHub runner and the EAS builder, or CI starts a
build on every push and its updates reach nobody. `fingerprint.config.js` holds what makes that true:

- `extra` is skipped: it is JS config carried by each update, and it varied with whether `.env` existed.
- `eas.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services.json` are ignored. The Firebase files are
  gitignored, so they exist on a laptop and EAS but not on the runner.
- `ios.googleServicesFile` is a fixed path, `./GoogleService-Info.plist`. On EAS the
  `eas-build-pre-install` script in `package.json` copies the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_INFO_PLIST` file there.
  Before this it read the file variable's path, which differs per machine and changed the hash.

Compute it the way CI does, with the EAS production environment loaded:

```bash
eas env:exec production 'npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios' | grep '^{' | jq -r .hash
```

Run this before and after any change to `app.config.js`, `fingerprint.config.js`, `package.json` or
a native dependency. If a change should not be native but the hash moved, find out why before
merging. `eas fingerprint:generate --json` prints a banner before the JSON, so it does not pipe into `jq`.

## Config and secrets

- App config (Firebase web keys, Google client ids, Sentry DSN, `GOOGLE_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`) lives in
  the `production` environment on EAS. Builds read it, and the workflow passes
  `--environment production` to `eas update`, so no `.env` is needed in CI. Add new config there
  (`eas env:create`), not only in the local `.env`.
- Variables with Secret visibility on EAS (`GOOGLE_SERVICES_INFO_PLIST`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, the QF
  secrets) are readable only on EAS builders, not on the GitHub runner.
- GitHub repository secrets: `EXPO_TOKEN`, and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` (base64 of the plist).
  `eas build` resolves the native config on the runner before sending the build, which needs the
  plist at its fixed path, so the workflows write it from that secret first.
- The repository is **public**. Check a diff for keys before pushing.

## CI

- The app typecheck excludes `functions/` and `tests/firestore-rules/`. Each has its own
  dependencies and its own job.
- The rules tests need Java 21 (firebase-tools). When `firestore.rules` changes, update the tests in
  `tests/firestore-rules/` in the same change. They had drifted before.
- The release workflows use Node 22, which current eas-cli requires. CI jobs use Node 20.
- There is no Maestro job. The flows run locally (`npm run test:e2e:ios`) against a dev client.

## TestFlight

- App Store Connect app id `6767990248`, team `CH8N5V9MA6`, bundle id `com.revisionbuddy.app`, Expo
  project `achilles1802/revision-buddy`.
- **TestFlight builds expire 90 days after upload.** If native code has not changed in a while, run
  `EAS Build` from the Actions tab before the installed build expires. The new build has the same
  fingerprint, so current updates reach it.
- A failed submission does not need a rebuild:
  `eas submit -p ios --id <build id>`. `eas submit:list --platform ios --json` shows the error.
- Apple refuses uploads while an agreement is unaccepted ("A required agreement is missing or has
  expired"); retries can then fail with no message at all. Check App Store Connect > Business: the
  Free Apps Agreement must be Active. The Paid Apps Agreement does not block a free app.
- Auto-submit cannot add builds to the `Team (Expo)` TestFlight group (Apple 403); add a new build to
  the group by hand in App Store Connect.

## Known-good reference

Tag `testflight-10-ota-sep30` is the code that ran on TestFlight build 10 with the Sep 30 updates,
the last release made from a laptop. Build 11 (fingerprint `c5e09f6…`) is the first built by CI.
